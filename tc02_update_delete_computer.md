### Improvements for Update & Delete Computer Flow

|ID | Precondition | Improvement |
|:-:| :----------: | :---------- |
| UDIM-001 | UDCI-001 | `Save this computer` button should be inactive until user types at least 1 valid character into the `Computer name` field. 
| UDIM-002 | UDCI-002 | `Computer name` field should have character limitation rules. Minimum 1, Maximum 50 characters should be allowed. User should not be able to type more characters after reaching 50 characters.
| UDIM-003 | UDC-003 | User shouldn't be able to enter the same computer name over and over again. Currently, I can add as much as I want, with the same computer name. This sitaution cause future conflicts. In this case, user should be warned with a message like `Entered computer name exists. Please try to update with another name.`.
| UDIM-004 | UDCI-003, UDCI-005 | `Introduction date` field should have a date picker to eliminate wrong user behaviours. Date picker's date range can be limited, i.e. "1930 - Present", since the first computer was invented in 1936. So, instead of highlighting the date format by writing "Date ('yyyy-MM-dd')" near the field, we can write "Optional" for better user experience. Selected date can be formatted automatically and pasted into the field by this way.
| UDIM-005 | UDCI-004, UDCI-006 | `Discountinued date` field should have a date picker to eliminate wrong user behaviours. Date picker's date range can be limited, i.e. "1930 - Present", since the first computer was invented in 1936. So, instead of highlighting the date format by writing "Date ('yyyy-MM-dd')" near the field, we can write "Optional" for better user experience. Selected date can be formatted automatically and pasted into the field by this way.
| UDIM-006 | UDC-013 | After updating an existing computer, user may want to update one more computer again. However, for some reason user may click on `Back` button. In this case, currently, previously updated computer's information message is displayed as; `Done! Computer {computer_name} has been updated`. This situaiton misguides the user and it's not preferable user experience.
| UDIM-007 | N/A | All these features and screens should be tested on **responsive web**. Currently, it's not supported and causes UI bugs.
| UDIM-008 | N/A | All these features and screens should be tested on different browsers, **cross-browser** testing should be performed, (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, Edge, Opera). Currently, it's not supported as well.
| UDIM-009 | N/A | All these features and screens should be tested on different Operating Systems, **cross-platform** testing should be performed. Currently, it's not supported and causes dislocations on table list.
| UDIM-010 | N/A | All these features and screens should be tested on **mobile devices, tablets, etc.** Or, "Mobile Friendliness" test should be performed. Here are some results: <ul><li>**Page is not mobile friendly.**</li><li>Clickable elements too close together.</li><li>Viewport not set.</li><li>Text too small to read.</li></ul>
| UDIM-011 | N/A | All these features and screens' speed should be tested in order to evaluate the performance. Here are some results: <ul><li>PageSpeed Score: (A-94%)</li><li>Fully Loaded Time: (0.5s)</li><li>Total Page Size: (52.3KB)</li><li>Requests: (3)</li></ul>
| UDIM-012 | UDC-011 | "Deleting" action should require a "Confirm Box" in order to prevent loss of data easily.

**Note: Test cases above could've been grouped and structured logically when using any test management tool such as TestRail.** 

**Note: Bug reporting and improvement suggestions could've been performed in a much more structured way when using a tool such as Jira.**
